Classes:
    State: Enum representing the learning state of a Card object.
    Rating: Enum representing the four possible ratings when reviewing a card.
    Card: Represents a flashcard in the FSRS system.
    ReviewLog: Represents the log entry of a Card that has been reviewed.
    Scheduler: The FSRS spaced-repetition scheduler.
